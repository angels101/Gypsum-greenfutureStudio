Gypsum board is the result of the evolution of the building industry. For thousands of years, plaster made from lime, sand, animal hair and other ingredients was used to create a smooth interior finish. Later, it was discovered that gypsum dried faster than lime, so gypsum became the main ingredient in plaster. It wasnâ€™t until well into the 20th century, though, that sheets of plasterboard began to replace traditional wet plastering.
